The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the app is not properly initialized or if there is a network issue.  This can result in unexpected behavior or crashes. For example, if you try to access the database before the app has finished initializing, you may get an error indicating that the database is not connected. Additionally, if there's a network problem, operations that require network access will fail.
