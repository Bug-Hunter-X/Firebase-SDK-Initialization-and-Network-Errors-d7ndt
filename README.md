# Firebase SDK Initialization and Network Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Firebase SDK:  failure to properly initialize the SDK or handle network connectivity issues.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Problem:

The original code attempts database operations before ensuring Firebase is initialized and without handling potential network errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior or app crashes.

## Solution:

The solution uses asynchronous initialization and `try...catch` blocks to handle potential network errors and provides better error messaging to the user.
